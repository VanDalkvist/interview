**What is the difference between classes and ID's in CSS?**

First of all you should not place elements with same ID in page more then once. That's why you can select only one element by ID. Classes more flexible in that case. You can make multiple selections by class name.
ID selector starts by #-hash sign, class selectors start by "."-dot symbol.
